# Clustering-Algorithm
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.

# Dataset
Use the Iris dataset available in the sklearn library.

# Key components to be fulfilled :

1. Loading and Preprocessing 
Load the Iris dataset from sklearn.
Drop the species column since this is a clustering problem.

2.Clustering Algorithm Implementation 

Implement the following two clustering algorithms:
A) KMeans Clustering  
Provide a brief description of how KMeans clustering works.
Explain why KMeans clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
Apply KMeans clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualize the clusters.

## KMeans Clustering :- K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. The article aims to explore the fundamentals and working of k means clustering along with its implementation.

B) Hierarchical Clustering 
Provide a brief description of how Hierarchical clustering works.
Explain why Hierarchical clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
Apply Hierarchical clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualize the clusters.

## Hierarchical Clustering :- Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis in data mining that creates a hierarchical representation of the clusters in a dataset. The method starts by treating each data point as a separate cluster and then iteratively combines the closest clusters until a stopping criterion is reached. The result of hierarchical clustering is a tree-like structure, called a dendrogram, which illustrates the hierarchical relationships among the clusters.
